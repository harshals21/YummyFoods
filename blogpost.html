         <p class="font1">Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in cooking with those of blog writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of them focus specifically on food photography.As long as it is about food it is considered as food blog. Most often a food blog has overlapping elements of all or some of these elements. A blog is a personal journal and there is no real rule of writing a food blog.

            Food and travel is a particularly compelling type of food blogging because it involves the engagement of different cultures. These bloggers travel around the globe, visiting and eating their way through cities known for food like Bangkok, Chengdu, and Tokyo, as well as lesser known hot food spots like Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, and Karachi, documenting their experience as they go. Food and travel blogging involves a lot of research, shooting, editing, investing & scheduling involved. These blog hosts bear the challenge of embracing other cultures and experiences, even if that means stepping out of their comfort zone.</p>
         <p class="font1">Blogging is a key marketing and brand development tool for any cause. It's common practice for restaurants, catering companies, meal delivery services, private chefs, and other food and beverage businesses to turn to influential food-bloggers and use their audience to raise awareness for their business. It's important for these businesses to choose the influential bloggers in the market, or "influencers". Popular food-bloggers, like all other successful bloggers, are able to draw a specific audience and build their reputation by consistently posting quality content. Over time, the blogger accumulates influence over some of their audience. Consumers often build a connection with the blog host(s) they closely follow affecting their buying decisions. In the eyes of professional marketers, these influencers are key to spreading word of the company they represent to the appropriate buyer personas. This is what the blogger can "sell" to companies whose products and services they'd endorse or be sponsored by.</p>
         <p class="font1">The more popular a blog is, the more opportunities the blogger will have to monetize their content. Bloggers use a variety of business and marketing tactics to maximize traffic, the most important of which, is constructing a persona that can connect with the targeted audience.</p>
