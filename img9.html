    <p> Rasgulla or Rosogolla (Bengali: Rosogolla) (Odia: Rasagola) is a South Asian syrupy dessert
        popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings
        of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until
        the syrup permeates the dumplings.

        The dish originated in the Eastern part of Indian Sub-continent; the present-day Indian states of Odisha and
        West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. Bangladesh also claimed to be its birthplace but didn't
        applied for Geographical Indications tag for Rosogolla.
