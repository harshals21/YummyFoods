    <p>Dhokla is a vegetarian culinary dish that is found mainly in the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of adjacent
        states.[1] It is made with a fermented batter derived from rice and split chickpeas.[2] Dhokla can be eaten for
        breakfast, as a main course, as a side dish, or as a snack. Dhokla is very similar to Khaman, however Dhokla is
        made of batter derived from mixture of rice flour and chickpea flour, whereas Khaman is typically made from
        Chickpeas gram and looks yellow in color. Khaman has become widely popular outside Gujarat but is misunderstood
        or incorrectly known as Dhokla.
