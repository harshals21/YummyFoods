    <p> A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat,
        usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame
        broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments
        such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island
        dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a
        cheeseburger.
        Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may
        sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There
        are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.</p>
