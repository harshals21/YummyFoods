    <p> Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or extruded, into
        long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.

        Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are also often
        pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material
        composition and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of noodles.
