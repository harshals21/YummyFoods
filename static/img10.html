    <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their
        oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be
        simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and
        pies.

        The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and
        leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include
        dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the
        primary ingredients. </p>
